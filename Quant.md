## Robust Portfolio Execution Trading Algorithm with ML [Proven Over 10 Years on Real Trading Accounts with Over 1000 Users | MQL5, C++, Python]

Over the past decade, I have played a pivotal role in developing and maintaining a proprietary trading algorithm that has significantly influenced the Brazilian stock market. As a senior machine learning engineer at Metarobos, I spearheaded the creation of one of the first automated trading robots available to individual investors in Brazil. This innovation not only democratized access to sophisticated trading tools but also set new industry standards for security, transparency, and performance consistency.

**1. Algorithm Development and Programming**

Leveraging my expertise in **MQL5**, **C++**, and **Python**, I designed and implemented an object-oriented trading algorithm optimized for rapid execution and scalability. Recognizing the critical importance of reliability in financial systems, I established a zero-tolerance policy for bugs. This involved rigorous testing protocols, including unit tests, integration tests, and stress tests, to ensure the algorithm's robustness before deployment. My commitment to code quality and performance optimization was fundamental in achieving a system capable of operating flawlessly in real-time trading environments.

**2. Ensuring Order Execution Security**

Understanding the catastrophic risks associated with automated trading errors, I developed multiple layers of verification and risk control within the algorithm. A key focus was mitigating the danger of "order looping," a scenario where execution failures could trigger an uncontrolled series of trades, potentially leading to substantial financial losses within minutes. To prevent this, I implemented safeguards such as real-time execution confirmations, timeout mechanisms, and automatic shutdown protocols in case of detected anomalies. These measures ensured that the algorithm could operate securely, even under adverse conditions.

**3. Maintaining Operational Consistency Across Diverse Client Environments**

One of the significant challenges was ensuring consistent performance across a diverse client base with varying hardware, internet connectivity, and brokerage platforms. To address this, I developed an adaptive synchronization mechanism that could seamlessly integrate with multiple layers of execution, including:

- **MetaTrader Client**
- **Brokerage Platforms**
- **Stock Exchange Interfaces**
- **Client and Broker Internet Variability**
- **Real-Time Stock Data Feeds**
- **Multiple VPS Configurations**

By standardizing data handling and execution processes, I ensured that all clients received uniform results, thereby establishing trust and reliability in our services. This level of consistency was a distinguishing factor in our sustained success, especially when many competitors failed to maintain operational integrity over time.

**4. Delivering Profitable and Adaptive Trading Models**

To ensure that our algorithms consistently generated positive returns, I integrated advanced machine learning techniques to adapt to evolving market conditions. This involved:

- **Continuous Model Improvement:** Regularly updating models to reflect the latest market data and trends.
- **Robust Validation Techniques:** Employing cross-validation, backtesting, and forward testing to prevent overfitting and ensure model generalizability.
- **Rigorous Generalization Testing:** Subjecting models to diverse market scenarios to verify their robustness under different conditions.

These practices ensured that our trading algorithms remained effective over time, delivering real financial gains to our clients.

**5. Providing a Diverse Portfolio of Strategies**

Recognizing that investors have varying goals and risk appetites, I developed multiple trading strategies to cater to different profiles. Clients were offered:

- **Customized Strategy Options:** A range of pre-built strategies optimized for different market conditions.
- **Educational Resources for Strategy Development:** Training programs and materials enabling clients to create and refine their own strategies.
- **User-Friendly Tools:** Interfaces and analytics that allowed clients to monitor and adjust their strategies in real time.

This approach empowered clients to take control of their investments while benefiting from our sophisticated algorithmic infrastructure.

**6. Fostering Client Education and Market Maturity**

Given the nascent state of algorithmic trading among individual investors in Brazil, I prioritized client education to bridge knowledge gaps. Initiatives included:

- **Comprehensive Courses:** Developing curriculum covering algorithmic trading basics, risk management, and platform utilization.
- **Weekly Webinars:** Hosting sessions to discuss market trends, platform updates, and answer client queries.
- **Dedicated Support:** Providing personalized assistance to help clients navigate the system effectively.

By enhancing investor understanding, we not only improved client satisfaction but also contributed to the overall maturity of the market.

**Operational Excellence**

Throughout my tenure, I maintained an unwavering commitment to operational excellence and reliability. The systems I developed operated continuously for over ten years without a single critical errorâ€”a testament to meticulous attention to detail and proactive risk management. This level of performance is rare in the high-stakes environment of automated trading, where even minor oversights can have catastrophic consequences.

My extensive experience in developing and managing complex trading algorithms has honed my skills in machine learning engineering, system optimization, and high-reliability programming. I possess a deep understanding of both the technical and strategic aspects required to succeed in environments where precision and dependability are paramount. I am confident that my proven track record and expertise will make a significant contribution to any forward-thinking organization seeking to innovate in the field of machine learning.

## Tool for Creation and Analysis of Portfolio Trading [Calculating Risk-Return, Optimizing Best Portfolios, and Visual Analysis | MQL5, C++, Python]

In addition to my previous work, I developed a robust tool for the creation and analysis of trading portfolios. This tool focuses on calculating risk-return metrics, optimizing portfolio compositions, and providing advanced visual analyses. Utilizing MQL5, C++, and Python, I implemented efficient optimization algorithms that help investors identify the best portfolios tailored to their risk tolerance and investment objectives. The tool features intuitive visualizations that simplify complex financial data, enabling users to make informed decisions quickly. This project highlights my expertise in optimization techniques and visual analytics, further demonstrating my senior-level proficiency in machine learning and financial engineering.
