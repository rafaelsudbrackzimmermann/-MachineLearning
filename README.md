#### Project Overview
**The Problem:**
Energy management in buildings often lacks detailed insights due to the absence of extensive metering, making it challenging to identify how specific systems like heating and cooling contribute to overall energy consumption.

**The Solution:**
To address this, our team developed a solution using an unsupervised learning approach with the Adjusted STL (Seasonal-Trend Decomposition using LOESS) algorithm. This method improves upon traditional energy disaggregation techniques by adapting to complex and noisy data without needing predefined labels or extensive historical data inputs.

**Impact:**
This unsupervised and adaptable approach allows building managers to effectively monitor and control energy usage for various systems without the need for complex and expensive sub-metering infrastructure. By leveraging basic meter data, our model provides a scalable and economically viable solution for energy management across diverse building environments.

**Competition Results:**
- **nMAE**: 0.235 (Ranked 1st)
